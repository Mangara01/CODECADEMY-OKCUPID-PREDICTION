# Predicting Zodiac Signs with PyCaret

This repository is dedicated to predicting the zodiac signs of OKCUPID users using machine learning classification, specifically leveraging the PyCaret library. OKCUPID is a popular dating platform where users often provide their personal information which can be used to predict their zodiac signs. The goal of this project is to develop a zodiac sign prediction model to enhance user experiences and recommendations on OKCUPID.

## Key Feature

In the date_a_scientist.ipynb notebook, you will find PyCaret code for:

* Building and defining the zodiac sign prediction model, which is a classification task.
* Compiling and training the model on the preprocessed dataset.
